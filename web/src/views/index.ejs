           <p>Welcome to Anti-Libary.</p>
           <br/>
           <p> Anti-library is a term that was coined by <a href="/authors/5c71a9a28fb930420ca71f01">Nassim Nicholas Taleb</a> (author) in his 
           book <a href="/books/5c71aefa8fb930420ca72011">The Black Swan</a> for a concept he described in the context of Umberto Eco (1932-2016).</p>
            <br/>
           <p>The idea is that a private library is normally a collection of books that the owner has read and that there is little value in retaining 
           these books unless one is going to refer to them from time to time. 
           <b>A better idea is a collection of books one owns but hasn't read yet</b>, representing a corpus of 
           potential learning. The name given for this was <b>anti-library</b>.</p>
            <br/>
           <p>A good library is filled with mostly unread books. That is the point. Our relationship with the unknown causes the very problem
           Taleb is famous for contextualizing in many of his works. Because <b>we underestimate the value of what we don't know
           and overvalue what we do know</b>, we fundamentaly misunderstand the likelihood of rare events.</p> 
            <br/>
           <p>The antidote to this overconfidence boils down to our relationship with knowledge.
           The anti-scholar, as Taleb refers to it, is “someone who focuses on the unread books,
           and makes an attempt not to treat his knowledge as a treasure, or even a possession, 
           or even a self-esteem enhancement device — a skeptical empiricist.”</p>
            <br/>
           <p>Your anti-library serves as a visual reminder of what you don't know.</p>
